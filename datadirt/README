Datadirt - a live sample playback thing written in C and controlled by
OSC.

Released under the GNU Public License.  See COPYING for details.

(c) Alex McLean 2005

Some portions (c) Adrian Ward, this largely being a rehash of his MSG
software.  He released his code under the GPL as well though so that's
no problem for you.


INSTALLATION
------------

Currently tested under Linux (ubuntu).  Let me know if you get it to
work - alex@slab.org

The latest version should be available
at http://yaxu.org/datadirt/

You'll need the following two libraries installed before compiling
datadirt:

  liblo - lightweight OSC implementation
  http://plugin.org.uk/liblo/

  libsndfile1 - sound file library
  http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/

By default it'll output to /dev/dsp.  Edit config.h to change that, or
to switch on jack support.


USAGE
-----

To get it to make a sound, you'll need to send it the OSC message
'/trigger' with the following parameters.

All parameters must be supplied, with the OSC signature "sfffffsfffssffff".

string - sample name
float  - playback speed (1 is normal, -1 is reverse)
float  - waveshape (between 0 .. 0.99 is good, higher for overdrive)
float  - pan (-1 is full left, 0 is centre, 1 is full right)
float  - pan to (-1 is full left, 0 is centre, 1 is full right)
float  - volume (0 is silent, 1 is normal)
string - envelope name (one of 'percussive', 'tri', 'valley' or 'slope')
float  - analog feel strength (experimental, doesn't seem to work)
float  - analog feel frequency (experimental, doesn't seem to work)
float  - accellerate (best with very small values, try 0.00000001)
string - vowel (try 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' or 'u')
string - scale name ('equal' for equal temperament tuning, default is decimal)
float  - loops (number of times the sample is played, default is 1)
float  - duration (number of samples to play - incompatible with the 'loops' 
                   parameter)
float  - delay1 (two delay loops, send values between 0 and 1)
float  - delay2 

BUGS
----

Doesn't yet support OSC bundle timestamps.  This is the next thing to
do, and would need a patch to liblo.
