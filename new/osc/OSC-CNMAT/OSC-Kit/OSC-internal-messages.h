/* OSC-internal-messages.h

   Interface for having an application send OSC messages to itself
   internally.

   All these procedures return FALSE if unable to deliver the message.

/* Send a message immediately, with no return address.  This procedure
   returns after the message has been sent (or has failed to be sent),
   so the memory for address and args can be on the stack.  Returns FALSE
   if there's a problem; TRUE otherwise. */
Boolean OSCSendInternalMessage(char *address, int arglen, void *args);


/* Same thing, but with a return address supplied. */
Boolean OSCSendInternalMessageWithRSVP(char *address, int arglen,  void *args, 
				       NetworkReturnAddressPtr returnAddr);


/* Schedule some messages to occur at a given time.  This allocates one of the
   OSCPacketBuffer structures (see OSC-receive.h) to hold the addresses and argument
   data until the messages take effect, so if you're going to call this, you
   should take this use of packets into account in setting the
   numReceiveBuffers argument to OSCInitReceive().

   This provides an less general interface than OSC's bundle mechanism, because
   the bundle of messages you provide cannot include subbundles. 

   The addresses, arglens, and args arguments are arrays of size numMessages.

   There's no return address argument because you're not allowed to save a network
   return address for later use.
