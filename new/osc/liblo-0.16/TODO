* Bundle support [needs NTP, argh]

* Add source address to received messages

* More/better regression tests

* More/better example code

* Normalise URI handling [needs discussion]

* GTK/Qt/etc. linking code [maybe belongs in another library]

* OSC pattern matching [still not sure about this one]

* Rendevous/OpenWhatever (eg. howl) service discovery [low priority]

* Add a JACK transport layer [maybe, low priority]

* Make TCP work to spec (currently the TCP server only reads the 1st packet
  from every conneciton) [low priority]
