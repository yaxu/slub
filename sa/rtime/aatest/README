This example plays streaming audio out to the audio speaker under
Linux. Under Linux, type "make" in this directory to run the example.

To test this program under Macintosh OS X, copy the Makefile.osx file
to Makefile, and then type "make".

To test this program under IRIX, HPUX, or FreeBSD, see the Makefile
for modification details.



Testing under Windows MultiMedia Extension library
--------------------------------------------------

The simplest test under Microsoft Windows uses the Windows MultiMedia
Extension library, via the PortAudio library. First, run sfront:

sfront -aout pa_win_wmme -orc aatest.saol -sco aatest.sasl -midi aatest.mid

And then compile the sa.c file using either gcc:

             gcc -O3 sa.c -lm -lwinmm -o sa.exe

or Microsoft Visual C++:

             cl sa.c winmm.lib -o sa.exe

Execute the sa.exe file to stream the audio. 


Testing under Windows DirectSound
---------------------------------

Sfront also supports the Windows DirectSound system, via the Portaudio
library. To use DirectSound, you'll need a recent version of Developer
Microsoft Directsound installed on your machine, available from

            http://www.microsoft.com/directx/download.asp

To use sfront with Directsound, first run sfront:

sfront -aout pa_win_ds -orc aatest.saol -sco aatest.sasl -midi aatest.mid

And then compile the sa.c file using Microsoft Visual C++:

         cl sa.c dsound.lib dxguid.lib winmm.lib -o sa.exe

Execute the sa.exe file to stream the audio. 

If you have trouble with compilation, see this FAQ for DirectSound
installation issues:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?URL=/library/techart/DirectX8faq.htm

Note gcc probably won't compile DirectSound, but you can try it using:

     gcc -O3 sa.c -lm -lwinmm -ldsound -ldxguid -lwinmm -o sa.exe
