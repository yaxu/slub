This example lets you play pentatonic scales by using the ASCII
keyboard on your machine.  Under Linux, just type "make" in this
directory to run the example.

To test this program under Macintosh OS X, copy the Makefile.osx file
to Makefile, and then type "make".

To test this program under IRIX, HPUX, or FreeBSD, see the Makefile
for modification details.

The ascii driver isn't compatible with Windows, so this example
doesn't work.
