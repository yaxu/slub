This example is a simple reverb unit, that takes audio input from the
microphone input and plays a reverberated version through the
speakers. Beware of acoustic feedback when running this example.

The test this program under Linux, type "make" in this directory to
run the example. Use a mixer program like xmixer to select sources and
adjust the volume to avoid feedback.

To test this program under Macintosh OS X, copy the Makefile.osx file
to Makefile, and then type "make".

To test this program under IRIX, HPUX, or FreeBSD, see the Makefile
for modification details.


Testing under Windows MultiMedia Extension library
--------------------------------------------------

Note that this example has not been tested yet under Windows;
please send back bugs and performance reports. Thanks!


The simplest test under Microsoft Windows uses the Windows MultiMedia
Extension library, via the PortAudio library. First, run sfront:

sfront -ain pa_win_wmme -aout pa_win_wmme -orc linain.saol -sco linain.sasl

And then compile the sa.c file using either gcc:

             gcc -O3 sa.c -lm -lwinmm -o sa.exe

or Microsoft Visual C++:

             cl sa.c winmm.lib -o sa.exe

Execute the sa.exe file to stream the audio. Rerun sfront using the
-latency t flag, where t is a floating-point constant with units of
seconds, to test the latency behavior of the program.


Testing under Windows DirectSound
---------------------------------

Sfront also supports the Windows DirectSound system, via the Portaudio
library. To use DirectSound, you'll need a recent version of Developer
Microsoft Directsound installed on your machine, available from

            http://www.microsoft.com/directx/download.asp

To use sfront with Directsound, first run sfront:

sfront -ain pa_win_ds -aout pa_win_ds -orc linain.saol -sco linain.sasl

And then compile the sa.c file using Microsoft Visual C++:

         cl sa.c dsound.lib dxguid.lib winmm.lib -o sa.exe

Execute the sa.exe file to stream the audio. 

If you have trouble with compilation, see this FAQ for DirectSound
installation issues:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?URL=/library/techart/DirectX8faq.htm

Note gcc probably won't compile DirectSound, but you can try it using:

     gcc -O3 sa.c -lm -lwinmm -ldsound -ldxguid -lwinmm -o sa.exe
