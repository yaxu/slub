This example is an interactive demo that is a simple envelope
follower.  It uses MIDI data from the MIDI In Jack to select notes for
a simple musical instrument, and audio input to modulate the amplitude
of the notes.

The test this program under Linux, type "make" in this directory to
run the example.

To test this program under Macintosh OS X, copy the Makefile.osx file
to Makefile, and then type "make". Note that sfront supports external
MIDI sources via CoreMIDI at present, but not virtual MIDI sources.
