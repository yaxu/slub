This example lets you use sfront networking with your own session.
See:

http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lazzaro/sa/sfman/user/network/

for more details.

Under Linux, just type "make" in this directory to run the example.

To test this program under Macintosh OS X, copy the Makefile.osx file
to Makefile, and then type "make".

To test this program under IRIX, HPUX, or FreeBSD, see the Makefile
for modification details. 

Sfront networking and the ascii driver isn't compatible with Windows,
so this example doesn't work.
