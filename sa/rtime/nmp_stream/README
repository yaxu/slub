This example lets you test sfront networking, by streaming MIDI file
data to the other members of a session. Use nmp_audio as the client
for the other session members. A real streaming server would work much
differently ... this example treats the stream as it would interactive
MIDI input.

Under Linux, just type "make" in this directory to run the example.

To test this program under Macintosh OS X, copy the Makefile.osx file
to Makefile, and then type "make".

To test this program under IRIX, HPUX, or FreeBSD, see the Makefile
for modification details.
