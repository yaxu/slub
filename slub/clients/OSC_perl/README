this is alpha code for using OSC in perl.
the relevant files seem to be:

sendOSC.pm
sendOSC.so
dumpOSC.pm

------------------------

put these in a directory where perl finds them.

see the the scripts in ./examples for usage examples

sending works via a wrapper for the original sendOSC program.
it per default uses typetags. if you want to disable them you have to tweak
the make_sendargv subroutine by adding "-notypetags".

dumpOSC is native perl.
in dumpOSC, the part for non-typetagged parsing is fucked. typetagged seems
to work pretty well thou.
